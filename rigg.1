.Ar engine
.Ar file
.Op Ar arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
serves as a thin,
.Ox Ns -adapted runtime wrapper for indie games based on certain engines
.Po
see
.Ar engine
.Pc .
.Nm
handles visibility of files by using
.Xr unveil 2
to hide those that conflict with execution on
.Ox .
This solves a common problem with commercial games based on open-source
frameworks like FNA, LibGDX, or HashLink.
In addition,
.Nm
also enforces a minimum-necessary filesystem view by default via
.Xr unveil 2 .
Some basic engine configuration for
.Ox
like dllmap for
.Xr mono 1
is included. More complex configuration like filesystem changes or
game-specific environment variables are out of scope.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar engine
Specify the engine to use.
Can select from:
.Ar mono ,
.Ar hl .
.It Ar file
The file to launch with the engine, e.g.
.Pa Game.exe
.Pq mono
or
.Pa hlboot.dat
.Pq hl .
.It Fl u
Set unveil mode.
.Ar strict
is the default and reduces read/write/create/execute permissions to a limited
set of paths and hides game files that interfere with execution on
.Ox .
.Ar permissive
only hides game files when needed for engine execution, but otherwise doesn't
restrict filesystem access.
.Ar none
disables all uses of unveil and is generally equivalent to running the
.Ar engine Ns 's
own binary.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose output.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
After successful launch of the engine, the
.Ar engine Ns 's
exit status is returned.
See engine-specific documentation.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Run Mono game
.Pa Game.exe
with
.Fl windowed
flag:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ rigg mono Game.exe -windowed
.Ed
.Pp
Run HashLink game
.Pa hlboot.dat
with verbose output:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ rigg -v hl hlboot.dat

.Sh CAVEATS
The selection of directories that are
.Xr unveil 2 Ns ed
may not cover all potential use cases.
Some games fail to launch or have bugs in
.Ar strict
mode if they try to
.Xr stat 2
.Pa /home
or other hidden directories.
