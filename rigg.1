handles availability of files by using

to hide bundled files that conflict with OpenBSD runtimes and libraries.
This is a common occurrence with commercial games based on open-source
frameworks like FNA, LibGDX, or HashLink.
Besides hiding the conflicting files,
.Xr unveil 2
is also used to enforce a restricted filesystem view of only the
minimum necessary.
